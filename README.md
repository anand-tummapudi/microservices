# Microservices
Here i would like to cover all required topics and quetions arise during development or in an interview in case of microservice development using Spring boot.
#### 1. What is dependency Injection?
IOC means giving the control back to framework. Spring framework uses IOC pattern to achieve DI. Instead of creating and calling the required dependent objects, spring framework takes the responsibility of creating all the required objects and make it available in the container.
#### 2. What is Spring Initializer?
Spring Initializr is a website or web-based tool used to set up Spring Boot projects in an easy and efficient manner. Spring Boot projects can be set up manually, but the configuration might be more time-consuming and confusing. Spring Initializr addresses this problem by laying the ground work for its users. We can access Spring Initializr at [start.spring.io](https://start.spring.io/)
